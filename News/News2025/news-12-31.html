                            <p>The End of the Year Review.</p>
                            <p>Its been another year another slog, more slop, more shit and piss and puke. It would be an understatement to compare this year to a moldy cum-sock that is rotting under the bed and slowly giving you some fungus induced schitzophrenia.
                                <br>I made a bunch of art this year, I think less than in other years but I cant really tell, thats what it feels like at least. I made a bunch of profile pictures this year, one for each month, and am continuing a tradition that started a year or two ago.
                                I think there are some good ones in there somewhere. I will write something to them at that section. 
                                
                            </p>

                                <p><b>Number 10</b>
                                <br>Coke 300. 300 grams of sugar in a single can, what else do you need? Of course, looong cigarette, to round off the experience.
                                <br>Overall very happy with the peice, even though it is just two item illustrations. The template is nice, it works really well with the item and the whole thing just looks really dynamic.
                                </p>

                                <p><b>Number 9</b>
                                <br>One of my favorite portraits from this year. It was semi from memory, I think I used two different references for the clothes and the pipe. The face is straight from the dome though.
                                <br>Also the framing of the portraits in that polaroid esque template is nice.

                                <br>One of my favorite walkers I drew this year after noticing I didn't draw any walkers in a bit. I think it is my ideal of a walker. Legs and a turret.
                                <br>Most of my mech designs these days derive from that. Don't get me wrong, humanoid mechs are cool, but there is something to a chassis mounted cannon.

                                <br>A doodle page from when I was brainstorming symbols. This would eventually lead to my Rising Dove design, that I am quite fond of.
                                </p>

                                <br>Glorpo Snake. Always happy to get commissioned for silly stuff. This was originally for a sticker, I dont know if that ever went anywhere but the design really works by itself too I think.
                                <br> I think I did good especially on the sounding rod with the soft shading complimenting the cell shading.
                                </p>

                                <br>Another commission but one that I am also really fond of still. I do think I nailed the moths and esecially the caterpillar very well.
                                <br>The framing with the light around the subjects does give the whole thing a sort of exhibition vibe I quite like.
                                </p>

                                <br>One of my favorite tanks from this year. I think I married the oscilating turret with a square design quite well and really like what I did with the cannon mounting.
                                <br>The slim hull and the chonky tracks also work really well together and I forgot what the symbol on the side was meant to be (or even if it had meaning), but I like it too.
                                </p>

                                <br>I didn't do a lot of character illustrations this year but around summer/fall, the bug bit me and I drew a few guys with guns.
                                <br>This sherrif guy is my favorite, I think I nailed the checked-out-ness of someone who hates being places haha.

                                <p><b>Number 1</b>
                                <br>As you can see, two images in the number one spot. Thats because in my mind they kinda belong together. Showing my main two OCs at their workplaces.
                                <br>I made these after coming back from a slump where I didnt feel much like drawing and I think that did a lot for how they turned out.
                                Getting to recoup and then return with something thats even better is what its all about. 
                                <br>In the end I like all the detail I put in the enviornment, frankly in the second one its a bit more and I would redo the first one, add some pen cups and reference images.
                                But overall the vibe is good in both, just some seedy flash photography.

                                <p><b>Media Recap 2025</b>
                                <br>I did a lot of media this year. Watched more movies than ever before, mainly because I only ever watched movie when they were on TV and since I stopped having a TV 5 years ago, I stopped wathcing movies basically all together.
                                <br>So when I say "a lot" I mean like, 4.
                                <br>Anway, this is a short list of my favorite media from this year, mainly expressing itslef through music and youtube links.
                                </p>

                                <p><b>The Three Penny Opera</b>, this is the movie version from 31 which changes quite a bit about the play but keeps the general gist. I saw the play some few years back in the original german and been hooked since. 
                                <br>Give the songs a listen and watch the mobie.
                                <br>

                                <p><b>Fire In The Sky</b>, just a good song I like that I think captures the hope of space travel.
                                <br>

                                <p>Recently been enjoying <b>Daniel Kahns</b> music. I have always been a fan of Klezmer. He does a lot of covers of popular songs in yiddish too, which I find pretty cool
                                <br>

                                <p>I dont know how I stumbled across <b>Chicha Libre</b>, this shit just happens to me.
                                    They make some wonderful latin american rock music.
                                    They use a lot of musical references in their songs, which I find enjoyable.

                                <p>A song from a mashup album that is partly on here for nostalgia.I do think the mashup is catchy and cleverly executed but I would lie if I said I liked it solely for that and not also the way it reminds me of my early internet days.

                                <p>I watched a lot more movies this year. <b>Brazil</b> being one of them, the intro music was in my youtube wrapped this year as a top song xD. This part of the OST is not it, but its one I love.

                                <p>Color me surprised when I learned that Frank Sinatra is a hack fraud stealing from people /s
                                <br>Either way, original version of "My Way" is french, who'd have guessed? Not sure I like it more than the english one, especially this version. But its cool.

                                <p><b>RIO REISER RIO REISER RIO REISER RIO REISER</b> in: Ton Steine Scherbe, as relevant as always, sadly lol. Well they make good songs to sing a few beers deep and full of Weltschmerz.
                                <br>"Allein machen sie dich ein" has a very jolly motivating beat, its masterful.

                                <p>Watched <b>ZARDOZ</b> this year, its become one of my favorite movies. If I were a coward I would say something like "if you can look past its flaws, you will see it touch on topics that are as relevant as ever" however I don't think it has flaws. Fuck you.
                                <br>

                                <p>Lastly, watched Venture Bros this year, and I can see why people love it so much. Its clever with its continuity and stories. Also the way I found out about ZARDOZ. Video is of the trailer for the movie which semi-ends the series after it was cancelled, sadly.
