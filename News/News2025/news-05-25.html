                        <p>This interview features Aludra, she is located in the USA and I first got to know her two (?) years ago on Gus's "DoodleCrew" discord server. She is always pretty lighthearted and while we do clash with our general sentiments sometimes I appreciate her optimism. 
                        <br/>She mainly does furry art with some other general doodles too, as you will see over the length of this interview and I really enjoy her style and especially her lineart. The interview turned out a bit more informal than the last one in some ways but I hope you lot enjoy it.</p>

                        <p><b>Soho:</b><br/>
                        Alright I will start of with what you could call some more formal questions.
                        <br/> <br/>Did you have any classical schooling as an artist?
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                    
    
                        <p><b>Aludra:</b><br/>
                        I don't have any classical or official schooling, everything is self taught. I'd say I at least took art in high school, but the classes never taught the 'why's of art, only that we needed to follow exactly what the teacher said and did or we'd fail. Thankfully there's plenty of free resources out there to learn any type of art.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
    
                        <p><b>Soho:</b><br/>
                        Most definitely, a lot of art teacher in highschool just don't have their heart in it. While the internet does free up access to knowledge there are also a bunch of really bad tutorials out there. 
                        <br/> <br/>
                        How did you go about collecting resources and tutorials? 
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                            
                        <p><b>Aludra:</b><br/>
                        Getting the resources is pretty easy nowadays, figuring out what you need to search for is the hard part. I typically don't follow tutorials, which is probably why I didn't learn the fundamentals 'til way later. But when I do run across an issue I need more answers for, I usually look for an image tutorial first. The ones with the little bits of text explaining a niche subject like subsurface scattering, and a few images as an example. It gets the point across quickly and I can easily share them with friends.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Soho:</b><br/>
                        I think I have some of the tutorials saved you provided at one point, at least some visual references you sent my way. <br/>
                        You say you don't follow tutorials or learned the fundamentals, so what set you upon your path to make art in the scope you are making it now? <br/>
                        And when did you first start out drawing in that scope?
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                            
                        <p><b>Aludra:</b><br/>
                        Aww, I'm glad you saved some of them! 
                        Of all things, what got me on the path to wanting to take art more seriously was character creation. 
                        I always did little doodles and fanart for fun, but making a character was really the driving factor. 
                        I love all the design aspects, like the thought behind choosing a color palette to represent a personality, or icons on their outfit for that subtle symbolism. 
                        When I started to take things more seriously was near the end of high school. You might think this is silly, but Neopets was my biggest influence. 
                        Not really the site itself, but the work other users would put into their pets--their characters. 
                        Making websites for them, drawing designs, fleshing out stories, it was so inspirational and I still have my characters from that time.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
       
                        <p><b>Soho:</b><br/>
                        I don't think that is silly at all, I started out very similarly by making exclusively art for DnD characters! There is a art to it, you described it perfectly. And I think most of our readers might have their OC's that they cant get enough off. We have been talking about all this drawing but I havent asked you yet.
                        <br/> What is your favorite medium to work in?
                        <br/> And what medium is the one people would know you for, if those two differ?
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Aludra:</b><br/>
                        Hehe, yeah I'm really glad there's more places for people to make and share OCs, and that they fuel a lot of other artists' creativity too. My favorite medium? I'd have to say digital, and I'm mainly known for digital despite how little I draw. To me, it's one of the cheapest (in the long run), versatile, and accessible art forms out there. Also I'm practical and like that it saves physical space in my home. I do break out the traditional supplies from time to time, easier to put a sketchbook in your bag than a desktop computer, but I definitely prefer the freedom and ease of digital.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Soho:</b><br/>
                        And what does your typical workflow look like when you draw digitally and how long do you work on average on a piece?
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Aludra:</b><br/>
                        My typical workflow: I pick a character, then spend way too long trying to find a pose reference if I don't have one clear enough in mind. Sketching that pose comes next, though it gets refined so much that it feels more like I'm sculpting than sketching. Bold outline, flat base colors, one to two layers of shading, one layer of highlighting, final details and I'm including the background in that group, and done. On average I work about an hour at a time, but I'm aware I can get something out pretty fast, within a few hours or so, if I put my full focus on a piece.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Soho:</b><br/>
                        I think that is a very traditional workflow in the digital art sphere. Its at least the one I mainly see too.
                        <br/><br/>
                        You said you predominantly draw characters. Is that your favorite subject to draw? Also do you have something completely different where you would say "I can't stop drawing this!"? Those two questions may sound similar at first but I came to realize that very often "favorite" and "obsession" can be different.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Aludra:</b><br/>
                        Nah I totally get you, there's definitely a difference. I love drawing my characters, mostly cause they're swimming around in my head constantly, so it's easy to picture them any time I want to try and draw something. But an obsession would have to be cat doodles, dolphin doodles, and these little dots-for-eyes chibis I grew fond of a few years ago. I tend to default to doodling cats whenever I'm testing a new art program or medium, or just want to draw something cute, simple, and recognizable to leave at a restaurant table.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Soho:</b><br/>
                        Do you have a piece or pieces you are the most proud of, that could serve as an example?
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Aludra:</b><br/>
                        Sure sure! My first time testing out Procreate, and of course it had to be a cat, with the little dots-for-eyes style I mentioned too.

                        <p><b>Aludra:</b><br/>
                        Honestly, probably this one of my character Sigh. I think I was able to capture her as accurately as I picture her in my head. I'm still proud of how soft her expression is, happy with my bold lines and line weight. Satisfied with the shading and gradients. It's one of the few finished works that I look at fondly and make me feel proud about my skills.

                        That drawing is very good, absolutely. I don't know this character of yours but I can definitely agree with you on the technical aspects you pointed out. I think that is also a good place to end this segment and go over to the one that is more cerebral (I haven't yet found a better word for it).
                        <br/> <br/>
                         I will just start with a simple one. What motivates you to make art?
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Aludra:</b><br/>
                        Simple answer to that is designing characters. A lot of what I do-- art, listening to new music, playing a game, looking at rugs in a store, is motivated by coming up with new character ideas or fleshing out existing ideas. Sometimes it's the other way around, but usually if I'm motivated, it's character related.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Soho:</b><br/>
                        You are mainly doing character creation then. Has that influenced you in any way how you see other people or the world? Both is a more philosophical but also maybe literal way?
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Aludra:</b><br/>
                        It has changed the way I see other people and my surroundings, physically and mentally. I focus a little more on how people carry themselves, how they walk, slouch, dress, accessorize, interact. It also makes me see bodies as shapes, as something fun to try and replicate. Same with buildings, stores, house layouts. I get to see them through the lens of another person. What would they think about a dirty table? Or would this look like overwhelming clutter to them? In a philosophical sense I guess that opens me up to different peoples' perspectives that I would've never thought of before. It definitely makes the mundane world more interesting when you notice things that many others overlook.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Soho:</b><br/>
                        I think we all develop a sort of "artist vision" that is specialized to what we create.
                        And maybe to turn the whole thing around. What are influences and experiences that influence you that may not be obvious to the typical observer? You mentioned Neopets before but I think that can be pinned down when looking, especialy at your critter doodles.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Aludra:</b><br/>
                        I think a non obvious one is when I mention I'm going shopping. I'm not just shopping for necessities, i'm looking around the whole store for weird ideas, color schemes, stationary and the like. Most of the time I'll leave the store without buying anything. I call it shopping for ideas. No I do not want or need a throw pillow, but I'll browse the throw pillow aisle to see if anything strikes my creative fancy. Also gets the gears turning in my brain which is always refreshing.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Soho:</b><br/>
                        Yeah I think its a good way to gather ideas. I think there is a sort of balance act when you are creative where you need to collect ideas and refuel you creativity tank, so to say. I havent yet heard people say that they brows shopping isles for that, and I really couldn't have pinned that down in your art.
                        <br/>I have one last question for this segment, then we get to a more lighthearted segment to finish up the interview.
                        <br/>Did you have any experiences that changed your art forever?
                        </p>
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Aludra:</b><br/>
                        Off the top of my head, I can't think of any one-time experiences that changed my art enough to be remembered. More like, snowballed into what it is today. I had a babysitter who did art and really encouraged me, and I think that's when I started taking it more seriously. Pet sites kept that snowball rolling afterwards.

                        Alright! I also have a similar upbringing but it was a afterschool teacher and DnD haha. I think a lot of people can relate to this, you get inspired by someone in your life and then draw whatever you love and run with it.
                        <br/> But contrary to drawing what you know: What's the silliest thing, or thing least in your wheelhouse, anyone has ever asked you to draw?

                        Oh gosh, I won't include nsfw requests out of courtesy, but I think one of the silliest things was a sprouted potato plant, as a tattoo? Like, roots and all. Even with their diversity, I just somehow don't turn out tattoo-worthy designs. I usually joke about these kinds of requests with "Oh you're an artist? Can you paint my house?"
                        </p>

                        A potato plant is kinda cute. How did you approach the whole thing? Especialy considering it was a tattoo request?
                        <br/>You are also free to include nsfw things is you want. That is not a problem.
                        </p>

                        Since it was from a friend, I did a silly little doodle of it, something absolutely not worth getting a tattoo over, cause I think at some point it was a joke? At least I hoped it was a joke, I don't think they ever got the tattoo thankfully. Here, I still have it actually.

                        If I can include nsfw then, an unserious nude pinup series of a strange SCP in an oni mask, which I actually drew. Otherwise, way too many random requests while streaming art. Picarto used to be an untamed wilderness.

                        I think anyone taking art requests online is bout to run into some strange requests. I remember getting some strange things through reddit and instagram. That potato plant is cute though.
                        <br/>Do you have any other hobbies outside of drawing?

                        Yeah, with the anonymity of being online, people tend to request the most odd of things.
                        I have waaaay too many hobbies, to the point where I need to trim some of them down. I play games a ton, and I used to speedrun years ago. Recently got into learning crochet. Perler beads, cross stitch, miniature dollhouse kits, jigsaw puzzles, decoupage. At this point it'd be easier to name crafty hobbies that I _haven't_ gotten into. One day I hope to add 3D modeling to that list.
                        <br/>
        
                        <p><b>Soho:</b><br/>
                        Hearing 3D modeling combined with dollhouse kits made me think that we need to get you into tabletop games with miniatures and stuff.
                        But most of those aren't really your vibe, I feel like.
                        <br/>A lot of people like to juggle things like these, I mean it never gets boring at least.
                        <br/>Also do you still have any hobbies you kept from Childhood?

                        Yepyep! I'm all for keeping old drawings, so I can compare my progress to myself over the years. I have a little doodle in a book from when I was around 7? Braids are hard. My first ever digital art (that wasn't mspaint), made with whatever art program my computer came with and a mouse. And then, some fanart of Zelda's Nayru from middle school. I was so proud of that one, got to use Prismacolor pencils on it and everything. Could not do hands, so I instead broke her arm in three places, broke her knee, and gave her the tiniest feet possible. It makes me smile now hehe.

                        Beef jerky, hands down. I don't get it often for that exact reason. Salami, smoked salmon, meat snacks in general. None of it lasts long in this house.
