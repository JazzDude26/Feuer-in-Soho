                                   <b>Epstein and beliving in nothing at all</b><br>
                                        One thing that I have observed with great interest since the Epstein Files have been released is the reaction of the online right in the USA.<br>
                                        While here in Europe we had some fallout from it, the US establishment seems to mostly not care about it. And how could they?<br>
                                        Each day US politicians are committing 10000000000000 Watergates and Iran Contras.<br>
                                        However the reaction of pundants, especially those on the Neo-Nazi spectrum, is really revealing to me. It reveals that they are truly only in it for the grift.<br>
                                        And this isn't new, we have been knowing for a long time that the rightwing media pivot is both easy and profitable. But man, I would have thought at least one of these guys had convictions. <br>
                                        For example with someone like Nick Fuentes. I would have expected that despite their contradictory identity as a mexican, manlet, re-closeted-gay neonazi, he was a real beliver. <br>
                                        But the Epstein thing really did bring out that he does not care. Because if he really was a born in t eblood nazi he would froth at the thing that have come out.<br>
                                        You telling me that a jewish banker was pulling strings behind the scenes for governmets, three letter agencies and the extremely wealthy? All while apparently organizing blood ritual baby torture rape parties for the same people?<br>
                                        That the gold mine if you were a nazi pundant with convictions. EVERYTHING you preached turned out to be at least 50% true? Thats the goldmine.<br>
                                        But what do you do? You go live on your little set and say that that man was "based" and sell merch with his insignia or whatever.<br>
                                        And same goes for someone like Joseph Bourdain Rogan Experience, who only seems to care about Bill Gates. And dont get me started on Alex Jones, conspiracy man No.1#.<br>
                                        They all either kissed the ring or are in it for the dosh.<br>
                                        Anyway, back to Fuentes, I thought he was somewhat inteligent but he is also just a outrage monger. He does not care about consitency, he doesnot belive into the project.<br>
                                        Which I don't exactly know what to make of it. On one hand it is scary that every rightwing pundant is just like that, stupid, without belive.<br>
                                        Because I find that it is really hard to combat someone with rethoric or actions, if they can just weasle out of it. Adittionally if they belive in nothing, there is no limit to the dismissal of murder,rape and torture.<br>
                                        On the other hand it is kinda reliving, to know that if you ever critcally looked on things for a day in your life, had a single critical thought, you are better than these people.<br>
                                        In every way, you are more reflective, more mature and a more pleasant person.<br>
                                        Either way, dont know were I wanted to go with this.<br>
                                        I guess Zizek talked about this some 5 years ago I think.<br><br>
                                        <b>RE:</b> Since I wrote this things happened, but mainly in EVROPA. While things in the american right wing have stayed, from my degree of informedness, about the same, the european right wing seems to have jumped on it in the way you expect<br>
                                        And it is kinda expected since large parts of the european right wing is pretty anti-USAmerican. For obvious disgusting and historic reasons.<br>
                                        <br><br>
                                        
                                    <b>Lupin III and the development of a comic</b><br>
                                        As I said in my previous blog post, I have been on a Lupin III Manga bender recently, and gotten to the point in the series where the main cast is introduced fully. Meaning, Lupin, Jigen, Fujiko and Goemon<br>
                                        And I have to say, once monkey punch figured out the direction of the manga it relly picked up. This was around chapter 17, somewhere there. Before it felt very disjointed. <br>
                                        And the Manga said it was but it was really extreme, the only constant till this point were basically Lupin and Zenigata, exposition happened to be delivered by random people, now it is often Jigen who does so.<br>
                                        Additionally it felt like Monkey Punch was not yet used tomaking the manga, which I think stems from the fact that Lupin was supposed to only run for 3 month but got popular. <br>
                                        So I guess it makes sense that by the point where it got more support and got to run basically indefinetly, Monkey Puch was more comfortable to establish more characters instead of one-offs.<br>
                                        Also it took till that chapter for him to not have every female charater that shows up be assaulted :/ idk it was the 60s<br>
                                        Either way I am glad it picked up in quality in that sense because it really started to drag, I have yet to see major improvements in his art, but the main casts are getting more consistent.<br>
                                        Also I really like that he uses Jigen for exposition now, sometimes Jigen even breaks the 4th wall just to say "good I showed up to deliver exposition lol" its kinda cute.<br>
                                        But yea he settled in a rythm now I think and has nailed the characters down, wich gives the manga, even though its still a "heist of the week" type deal a more consistent throughline, kinda like Star Trek or Scooby Doo<br>
                                        <br><br>
                                        
                                        <b>The Olympics and getting fond of sports</b><br>
                                        I recently found myself enjoying more winter sports, not seriously but I guess its fun watching a guy going/jumping fast on skis. Defenitely started when my flatmate took me with him to the ski jumping worldcup.<br>
                                        As of wrtiting this paragraph (because its been a week or two since the last one) I found myself at my parents for a weekend and of course they have the olymics on. While I have my gripes with the whole org,<br>
                                        I do get into rooting for the german team (it helps that they are pretty good). I enjoyed the giant slalom a lot, they are going fast and there is big potential for competition and crashes lol.<br>
                                        <br><br><br>

                                <br/>I dont know where I first saw Som's art, it was probably the DoodleCrew Discord, but I really enjoy their painterly style and controll over color and composition. Their website has a good mix between personal and fan art as well as some studies so there will probably be something for you to like there!</p>
