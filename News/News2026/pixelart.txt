I have been thinking about pixelart in a somewhat academic context, in the way that it is really not a thing anyone has ever written about in academics. Which makes sense, its a art form that has been closely linked to videogames which in themselves have only basically just gained reccognition as an  art form. Yet I cant help but find that pixel art and a artform that has found at least some accademic reccognition, embroidery. Especially counted-thread embroideries like cross stitch, were you are limited to the wrpas and wefts of the piece of cloth you are embroidering, giving very similar conditions to the raster grid of pixel art.

The artistic period of Biedermeier is well know for its cross-stitch "paintings" and pillows with floral images.
Especially with the inclusiuon of crossstitch embroidery into the educational curriculum of girls after the unification of germany under prussia, the grid bound construction of art, found its way into the everyday life, even though the art form is much older than that.

And besides the gird bound limitations of the artform we also have the limitsimpose by color. Pixealart has been historically bound to limited colors, which was at first because of hardware limitations, but as become part of the style. Imitation of different ardware limits are still popular today. In modern times, palettes like the Pico8 palette stemming from the pice of software supposedly emulation one of these old retro consoles, or the palettes curated on sites like Lospec, reach mass popularity with pixel-artists.
But similar limitations can also be found in embroiery, while you theoretically could have used infinite colors by dyeing the yarn one would embroider with in the desired color, it was much more economical to stick to a few colors. Thus basically preemting the use of similar techniques as in pixel art, in regards to the choice of color interactions.

But in the end the physical differences between the two are obvious, being that one is derived from a completely digital medium.

Explaining the term "retro"
A thing that I have seen some people talk about online recently, is the meaning of "retro" mainly in the sphere of videogames, but it also somewhat applies to fashion and interior design.
But first games. "Retro Games" roughly means the ones from the 1980s to the late 1990s, the year 2000 is a convenient cutoff point but nothing rigid. "Retro Games" are generally considered to be the low fidelity predecessors of "Modern Games" with polished graphics and high polygon counts. This contrast means that "Retro" is not only an epocial term but also a style descriptor, though the latter has to do with some bias that saw "realistic" games as better, as is arguable the games at the height of pixelart (something like Super Metroid) were extremely polished, both gameplay and art wise. Maybe the dip in polish we saw with early 3D games (Kingsfield, Mario 64 for exmaple) lead to te retroactive perception of that era as inferior. Either way.
"Retro" is often used as a style descriptor a "Retro-inspired Game" usually means specific artisic elements like that its 2D and Pixel art, and then some gameplay elements, usually harder difficulty emulating the arcade penny-snatching roots of the early home console games. But generally the term can not be applied to a singular style, "Castle Vania Symphony of the Night" might not differ gameplay wise from the first Castelvania much, but does so greatly artistically, which is mainly because of the lifted hardware limitations. So at most you could argue a style progression in the face of technological progress.
Meaning "Retro" means something else, specifically like I already wrote, a period descriptor, mainly from the 1980s to the year 2000. A period of games that stands in contrast with everything before and everything after. Before: Physical games and proto-videogames; After: gritty  brown shooters, smooth models and "realistic" enviornments.

Modern Pixelart vs "Retro" Pixelart
I was about to write something on tis too but the youtuber Noodle made a great video about it so I will just link that.
