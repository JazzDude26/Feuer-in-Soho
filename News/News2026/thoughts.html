<b>Epstein and beliving in nothing at all</b><br>
One thing that I have observed with great interest since the Epstein Files have been released is the reaction of the online right in the USA.<br>
While here in Europe we had some fallout from it, the US establishment seems to mostly not care about it. And how could they?<br>
Each day US politicians are committing 10000000000000 Watergates and Iran Contras.<br>
However the reaction of pundants, especially those on the Neo-Nazi spectrum, is really revealing to me. It reveals that they are truly only in it for the grift.<br>
And this isn't new, we have been knowing for a long time that the rightwing media pivot is both easy and profitable. But man, I would have thought at least one of these guys had convictions. <br>
For example with someone like Nick Fuentes. I would have expected that despite their contradictory identity as a mexican, manlet, re-closeted-gay neonazi, he was a real beliver. <br>
But the Epstein thing really did bring out that he does not care. Because if he really was a born in t eblood nazi he would froth at the thing that have come out.<br>
You telling me that a jewish banker was pulling strings behind the scenes for governmets, three letter agencies and the extremely wealthy? All while apparently organizing blood ritual baby torture rape parties for the same people?<br>
That the gold mine if you were a nazi pundant with convictions. EVERYTHING you preached turned out to be at least 50% true? Thats te goldmine.<br>
But what do you do? You go live on your little set and say that that man was "based" and sell merch with his insignia or whatever.<br>
And same goes for someone like Joseph Bourdain Rogan Experience, who only seems to care about Bill Gates. And dont get me started on Alex Jones, conspiracy man No.1#.<br>
They all either kissed the ring or are in it for the dosh.<br>
Anyway, back to Fuentes, I thought he was somewhat inteligent but he is also just a outrage monger. He does not care about consitency, he doesnot belive into the project.<br>
Which I don't exactly know what to make of it. On one hand it is scary that every rightwing pundant is just like that, stupid, without belive.<br>
Because I find that it is really hard to combat someone with rethoric or actions, if they can just weasle out of it. Adittionally if they belive in nothing, there is no limit to the dismissal of murder,rape and torture.<br>
On the other hand it is kinda reliving, to know that if you ever critcally looked on things for a day in your life, had a single critical thought, you are better than these people.<br>
In every way, you are more reflective, more mature and a more pleasant person.<br>
Either way, dont know were I wanted to go with this.
