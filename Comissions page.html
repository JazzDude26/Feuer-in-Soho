                <b>Commissions through Ko-Fi follow a different process.</b>
                <br>
                <br> To start the commission process, I will need :
                <p>A assessment of your budget</p>
                <p>Information of what the illustrations are for and the scope of the project</p>
                <p>A thoughrough description of the subject you want illustrated</p>
                <p>At least 3 image references</p>
                <br>
                <br> Communication can be done through my mail or through DM's on any of my socials.
                <br>
                <br> Payment upfront, no refunds.
                <br>
                <br> Once you've sent over any references and payment , I'll go on to work on the comision, of which I will give you updates throughout. At this stage I can make alterations untill you are happy with how its going. Once this is paid I
                will go on to send you the full illustration in its original resolution without a watermark. There will be an opportunity for amendments and revisions in color and small details once the illustration is complete.
                <br>
                <br> I will charge extra for higher detail work. This can be negotiated upfront.
                <br>
                <br> Depending on the ammount of commissions I currently have, the complexity of the piece and buyer communication, it will take me up to 6 weeks. Larger additional revisions after the product is finished will be 50% of the overall commission
                price.
                <br>
                <br>
                <hr> I will draw Fantasy/Furry/Mecha, tastefull nudity, light gore and most things in that ballpark.
                <br>
                <br> I won't draw Pornographic content, or otherwise offensive and hatefull things. No NFTs.
                <br>
                <br> I will draw in my style. I do not do style immitation.
                <br>
                <br> I reserve the right to refuse any commission I am uncomfortable with, even if it isn't listed in the TOS.
                <br>
                <br>
                <hr> You are not allowed to use my comissions commercially i.e. Merchandise, Prints, AI Training, Game Assets etc. All commissions fall under the license listed above. But a commercial use fee and license can be negotiated depending on the
                use.
                <br>
                <br> As the artist I keep the copyright to the work after german copyright law, and by commissioning me you reccognize that.
