To start the commission process, I will need a thoughrough description of the subject you want illustrated,
at least 3 image references and an estimate of the scope of the project as well as your budget. 
<br>
<br>
Communication can be done through my mail 
(jazzdude26@gmail.com) 
or through DM's on any of my socials.
<br>
<br>
Once you send me a message or mail 
I will get back to you with an quote and an agreement as
soon as I can, if I take any longer than 48 hours to 
respond, please send it again, it might have ended up in
the spam folder. Approving the quote and paying the advance 
fee (50% of your total) means you have agreed to the terms 
listed below.
<br>
<br>
Once you've sent over any references and approvd the quote
, I'll go on to work on the comision, of which 
I will give you updates throughout. At this stage I can 
make alterations untill you are happy with how its going.
Once the comision is completed I'll send you another invoice 
for the remaining 50% of your fee. Once this is paid I will go on to send 
you the full illustration in its original resolution without
a watermark. There will be an opportunity for amendments and revisions 
in color and lineart once the illustration is complete.
<br>
<br>
I will charge extra for higher detail work. 
This can be negotiated upfront.
<br>
<br>
Depending on the ammount of commissions I currently have,
the complexity of the piece and buyer communication,
it will take me up to four weeks.
Larger additional revisions after the product is 
finished will be 50% of the overall commission price.
<br>
<br>
<hr>

I will draw Fantasy/Furry/Mecha, tastefull nudity, light gore and
most things in that ballpark.
<br>
<br>
I won't draw Pornographic content, or otherwise 
offensive and hatefull things. No NFTs.
<br>
<br>
I will draw in my style. I do not do style immitation.
<br>
<br>
I reserve the right to refuse any commission 
I am uncomfortable with, even if it isn't listed in the TOS.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
You are not allowed to use my comissions commercially 
i.e. Merchandise, Prints, AI Training etc. All commissions fall under the license listed above.
But a commercial use fee and license can be negotiated depending on the use.
<br>
<br>
As the artist I keep the copyright to the work after
german copyright law, and by commissioning me you reccognize that.
