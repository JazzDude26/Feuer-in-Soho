                        Communication can be done through the Artists E-mail or through Direct Messages on any of the Artists socials. 
                        Once the Client sent over any references and paid the Artist via Bank Transfer or PayPal, the Artist will work on the commissioned illustration, of which the Artist will give the Client updates throughout. 
                        At this stage the Artist can make alterations until the Client is sattisfied with the design. Once the illustration is done, the Artist will go on to send the Client the full illustration in its original resolution as a .png, the original .clip and as a .psd. 
                        There will be an opportunity for amendments and revisions in color and small details once the illustration is complete. 
                        The Artist will charge extra for higher detail work. This can be negotiated upfront. 
                        Depending on the workload the Artist currently has, the complexity of the piece and the Client’s communication, it will take the Artist up to 6 weeks. 
                        Larger additional revisions after the illustration is finished will be 50% of the overall commission price.
