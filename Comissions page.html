<br>
To start my commissions and supply you with a quote,
I need a description of the subject you want drawn 
and the type of commission. The complexity of the 
design and in case of characetrs if there are any props,
for character posters what the background should be like.
References for prop, poster-style, clothing 
and pose are appreciated but not absolutely nessecary.
<br>
<br>
Communication can be done through my mail 
(jazzdude26@gmail.com) 
or through DM's on any of my socials.
<br>
<br>
Once you send me a message or mail 
I will get back to you with an quote and an agreement as
soon as I can, if I take any longer than 48 hours to 
respond, please send it again, it might have ended up in
the spam folder. Approving the quote and paying the advance 
fee (50% of your total) means you have agreed to the terms 
listed below.
<br>
<br>
Once you've approvd the quote and sent over any references
you have, I'll go on to work on the comision, of which 
I will give you updates throughout. At this stage I can 
make alterations untill you are happy with how its going.
Once the comision is completed I'll sendd you a Paypal invoice 
for the remaining 50% of your fee or you will pay the rest 
through my Ko-Fi and once this is paid I will go on to send 
you the full illustration in its original resolution without
a watermark. There will be an opportunity for amendments 
in color and lineart once the illustration is complete.
<br>
<br>
I will charge extra for higher detail work. 
This can be negotiated upfront.
<br>
<br>
Depending on the ammount of commissions I currently have,
the complexity of the piece and byer communication,
it will take me from 3 days up to four weeks.
Larger additional revisions after the product is 
finished will be 50% of the overall commission price.
<br>
<br>
<hr>

I will draw Fantasy/Furry/Mecha, tastefull nudity and
most things in that ballpark.
<br>
<br>
I won't draw Pornographic content, or otherwise 
offensive and hatefull things.
<br>
<br>
I will draw in my style. I do not do style immitation.
<br>
<br>
I reserve the right to refuse any commission 
I am uncomfortable with, even if it isn't listed in the TOS.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
You are not allowed to use my comissions commercially 
i.e. Merchandise, Prints, AI Training etc.
But a commercial use fee can be negotiated depending on the use.
<br>
<br>
No NFTs
<br>
<br>
As the artist I keep the copyright to the work after
german copyright law, and by commissioning me you reccognize that.
