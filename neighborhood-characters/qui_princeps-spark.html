Character profile
        <hr>
Spark has made some wrong turns throughout his short life,
but he is taking his new recidence as a chance to reinvent himself. 
Far away from those who manipulated him, he is now collecting stamps and
having a bbq every now and then, tho he lacks in guests for a "real bbq experience" 
as he calls it. His interest in anything fire, arms and explosives 
is a rather telling remnant of his past, tho he swore to never again
use it to inflict harm on another human being. Instead, he invests his experties
in fireworks and demolition jobs for his main income.
