        Stumps, former foreman at the loading docks. Lost his leg in a forklift accident.
        Since then he spends his time eating the government cheese and running his mmo guild.
        His old coworker Mancini is one of his neighbors but they don't talk much.
        His domicile front is fitted with a single fluorescent lamp,
        has overflowing garbage and mail.
        All due to the fact he really doesn't need to go out.
