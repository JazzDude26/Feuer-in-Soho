<div style="text-align:left;">                               
<br>
7450CE/0NA (Neo-Anthropocene)<br>
After a series of wars that would see the annihilation of a majority of cultures that developed or survived the end of the Anthropocene, a feudal government would unite the leftovers of humanity. Hence forth known as The Kingdom of Earth.
<br><br>
The empires establishes the Navy, a small fleet of vessels, manned by those most loyal to the King. The use of these ships is as orbital strike weapons whose firepower mainly serves the purpose to eradicate uprisings. 

<br><br>
1157NA<br>
Under the Kingdom, the Solar system would see some of its Anthropocene installations reactivated. 
The Lunar Orchards, the Shipyards of Jupiter. Fast Near Light Acceleration is rediscovered, technology to accelerate a large amount of mass close to light speed.  
                                    
<br><br>
1360NA <br>
Exploratory missions are sent out to other star systems.

<br><br>
1396NA<br>
The first missions return from Wolf 359, confirming a human presence in the system.
                                    
<br><br>                                    
1523NA<br>
A super factory by the Anthropocene company  "Danube Robotics" is rediscovered underneath the crust of Mars during exploratory mining and reactivated. Within it, blueprints for the FTL Link is found. A device that allows for instant travel across vast distances as well as locations for existing ones.
<br><br>
Robotics experiences a leap with the factory producing specialized robots at previously unimaginable quantities.
<br><br>
Ideal Standart is created, a wing of the royal government that produces and sets the bar for all goods to be produced and services to be enacted.
<br><br>
                                    
1777NA<br>
The first artificial mind is created. Those "Complex Machines" are confirmed to be sentient and sapient, capable of complex decisions and with an inherent instinct for self preservation. Inhibitors assure that they bend their knee to the King. They are produced for difficult hard labour too dangerous for humans, like extracting tritiated ice from asteroids. 

<br><br>
1898NA<br>
The Navy starts the Gould Mission. The goal is to erect FTL Links and Incorporate worlds into the Kingdom.
<br><br>
1909NA<br>
The first of these links ,"Porta Danuvia", connects Earth and Wolf 359.
<br><br>
2000NA<br>
Valkyrie Shipping is established, using  FTL Links to send goods from the far reaches of the Gould Belt to Earth.
<br><br>
2571NA<br>
The rapidly increasing size of the Kingdom results in their grasp slipping. Nobles that start uprisings to overthrow the king are destroyed and with them their worlds by orbital bombardment. However a small group of unaffiliated rebels smuggles construction orders into the Danube Robotics facility.
<br><br>
A facility previously only constructing civilian equipment, robots and complex machines was now producing both weapons and soldiers at a rate that had been unimaginable previously. 
Within a Martian month the planets defences are overwhelmed and the planet is captured. 
<br><br>
Other worlds try to follow within the steps of Mars, more or less successfully. Monarchist planets would fall in disarray others crush the rebellions. Billions would die.
<br><br>
2622NA<br>
Eventually the Kingdom of Earth would enter into negotiations with Mars. 
Negotiations would focus on the abolishing the monarchy and freeing both the people of the kingdom and complex machines.
<br><br>
A new provisional government would be formed to ensure a safe stepping down of the King.
<br><br>
2626NA<br>
The First democratic election is held throughout the Gould Belt with Parties from various worlds and interests taking office on earth.
<br><br>
The Kingdom of Earth is succeeded by the Gould Republic.
<br><br>
Systems like Serfdom and the widely spread manor system is abolished on many worlds that join the republic, in its stead a democratic system with a social market economy. Some worlds split off to form a monarchist rival state, the Empire of Gould. Vastly smaller than and relying on trade with the Gould Republic, they are begrudgingly upholding diplomatic ties.
<br><br>
3090NA<br>
Building up its offensive capabilities over centuries, the Empire of Gould would strike at the Republic. The following events happen over 48 hours and are known as "the swift blow".
<br><br>
- Sleeper agents in the Navy disable the FTL Link to the Sol system with an EMP.<br>
- A third of republic garrisons declare allegiance to the Empire.<br>
- The Empire forces seize control over government facilities on Mars and Earth as well as the Central Broadcasting facility that enables FTL communication for the Sol system as well as its neighbours.<br>
- Execution of loyalists generals, politicians and thought leaders is enacted throughout the system and the wider Gould Belt wherever Empire forces had the upper hand.<br>
- The rest of the Gould Republic is left in the dark about what happened, meanwhile the Emperor of Gould declares that the old Kingdom is re-established, with them as head of state.<br>
- Fighting erupts throughout the republic space as uninitiated royalists seize the moment.<br>
- Jupiter Shipyards see heavy fighting with Republic Navy forces being overwhelmed, the facility is badly damaged.<br>
- Danube Robotics becomes a stronghold for Republic forces taking up its role as a weapons factory once more.<br>
- Fighting continued in the Sol System for further seven years while both sides were burning through ammunition and manpower, being isolated from the rest of the Belt.<br>
<br><br>                                  
3097NA <br>
Seven years of fighting would end when a Republic fleet from Wolf 359 would arrive, large enough to fight off the traitors and secure reactivation of the FTL Link and Central Broadcasting. 
<br><br>
On many worlds the forces of the Empire tried to overthrow governments, nowhere as successful as on Earth though.
<br><br>                                  
The Sol System as well as other systems were in shambles and extremely dangerous to navigate at this point. Rogue smart mines, disassembly bots and shrapnel were covering space. Destroyed vessels and misfired weapons would regularly rain down upon the unfortunate moon or planet not lucky enough to be equipped with sufficient point defence.                                   
<br><br>                                  
The shipyard of Jupiter was in pieces, the orchards of Luna burned. Earth would see harsh winters, caused by impacts both of which would turn the urbanized landscape of the planet into ruins. Mars, though looking undisturbed, would see most its civilian population seek shelter in the underground facilities of Danube Robotics.                                  
<br><br>                                   
Earth would only sparsely be reconstructed, with most of the planet being handed over to nature to consume.
<br><br> 
The Second Republic would be founded this same year. Stating democracy, the right to roam, and that every sentient beings basic needs may be met on every world in its space as its main mission.
<br><br>
3319NA<br>
Reconstruction of Republican Worlds would be declared finished.
By this point the Empire of Gould had isolated itself in the outer arm, shutting down communication, travel and trade to republic space.
