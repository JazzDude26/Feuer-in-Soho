<h4>A short history of Mars</h4>
<br>
Post-Fall Mars would see a human being again in the year 1000NA when a Navy lander touched down. 
Today, the specifics of the mission are only known to scholars of Martian history but in the common mouth these settlers would be called the Children of Vulkan. 
This would be Year 0 for the Martian calendar.
<br><br>
With the slow reactivation of Anthropocene structures under Navy command, Mars would become mainly a mining colony at first.
Its crust, rich in minerals, supplied the Jupiter Shipyard and Earth.
Up until the [[Danube Robotics]] facility was discovered, the Martian people were seen as dirty blue-collar workers, digging up ore for the rest of the Sol-System.  

<br><br>
From then on out, Mars would see rapid urbanization and settling by the Navy bureaucratic body on the planet.
The Martian people however who had been living in its crevice's for close to 600 years now, would always be a thorn in the side of the governmental body.
The Martian spirit is a free one.  
                                    
<br><br>
With the discovery of Complex Machines in 1777NA and their mass production on Mars,
many Martian scholars would raise the concern about using technologies not fully understood for menial labour.
The King promises that the facility may never be used for the production of weapons.

<br><br>
2571NA would see a small group of Martian rebels infiltrating the Danube Robotics central construction computer,
loading plans on it for weaponized Complex Machines without inhibitors.
They would take up arms on the side of the rebels and  shortly overwhelm the forces stationed on Mars and soon sieging Earth itself. 
This is widely considered the origin point of the Martian Red Army, though some would tell you that they were around much longer.
                                    
<br><br>                                    
The time of the Orion Republic would see Mars lay down arms again and settle beck down into their place as a super producer of technologies.
The swift blow coup however meant that they needed to fight again.
While surprised by the swiftness of the coup, the royalists could never fully capture the Danube Robotics facility, this would allow Mars to hunker down and ramp up production of weapons once more. 
For 7 years, Martian forces would fight all over the Sol system until the fleet from Wolf 359 arrived.
Martian thinkers, politicians and generals would play a large part of erecting the Second Republic.
<br><br>
The martian people are often described as firm but friendly.
<br><br>

The Martian Red Army offers a variety of benefits to its members since it has
grown into a more organized body. This magzine cover advertises several
courses. Obviously the military side of the Army was always at the forefront
and even today, the machanized platoons are feard for their unique application
of battlefield strategy.
But the mech platoons are also often seen on Mars and other worlds carrying
out humanitarian and construction efforts.

Martian combat mechs and robots can be easily identified by their bulky frames and focus on mobility.
The comparatively lower gravity of Mars allowed for manufacturers to increase the amount of Armor frames could carry without much need for compensation in propulsion.
Since Martian frames need to operate off-mars, the need for strong legs arose.
Martian machinery tends to be on the bigger side.  
<br><br>
For armament, manufacturers preferred physical and explosive weaponry.
Opting for high calibre cannons and mortars instead of energy expensive weaponry.  
<br><br>
Mechanized frames of the Martian Red Army often bear a red colour to blend into their native environment and yellow insignia. 
<br><br>
Symbols of the army can range from simple depictions of Mars in its current state, with two small moons to reaching back to the Swift Blow  and the Anthropocene,
some more esoteric units field old symbols from Earth-cultures that got rediscovered in old databases.  
<br><br>
<h4>The Martain Calendar</h4>

<br><br>

<img src="https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/useruploads/display/c3824aa2-a408-4d35-a554-96526e57a2ea_martianyear.jpg" style="width:100%;display:block;">
<br><br>
The Martian year has 668 days, 16 months.
Each month has 42 days, except the last four, which have 41 days.
Martian months were named by the first post-fall pioneers after minerals found in the crust.
The Anthropocene Martian calendar looked similar, the months however were named different.
The Kingdom attempted to reintroduce this old calendar on Mars but it didn't stick.
