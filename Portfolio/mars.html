<h4>A short history of Mars</h4>
<br>
Post-Fall Mars would see a human being again in the year 1444u when a
USP lander touched down. Today, the spcifics of the mission are only known to
scolars of martian history but in the common mouth these settlers 
would be called the Children of Vulkan.
<br><br>
With the slow reactivation of Pre-Fall structures under FirstComm, Mars
would become mainly a mining colony at first. Its crust, rich in minerals, 
supplied the Theseus Shipyard and Cradle.

Up untill the Oracle Chorus installation was dicovered, the martian people
were seen as dirty blue-collar workers, digging up ore for the rest of the 
Sol-System.
<br><br>
From then on out, Mars would see rapid urbanization and setteling by the Union
beurocratic body on the planet. the martian people however who had been living
in its crevaces for close to 600 years now, would always be a thorn in the side
of the governmental body. The martian spirit is a free one.
<br><br>
During the Deimos Event, in 3002u and the Siege of Mars, cells would pop up,
that would support the newliy conjured Deimos-entities and engage in
skirmishes against Union and local police forces. This crisis would mark the first appearance
of the Martian Red Army, a democratically organized fighting force, that early
on would incorporate NHPs into its ranks.

<br><br>
During the Hercynian Crisis, the Martian Red Army would join forces with other
opposition cells and siege Union facilities on Mars and Cradle.
Today they exist as a independet militia and the more patriotic martians
proudly claim that they were the reason for SecComm being dissolved.
<br><br>
The martian people are often described as firm but friendly.
<br><br>

The Martian Red Army offers a variety of benefits to its members since it has
grown into a more organized body. This magzine cover advertises several
courses. Obviously the military side of the Army was always at the forefront
and even today, the machanized platoons are feard for their unique application
of battlefield strategy.
But the mech platoons are also often seen on Mars and other worlds carrying
out humanitarian and construction efforts.

Martian combat mechs and robots can be easily identified by their bulky frames
and focus on mobility. The comparatively lower gravity of Mars allowed for
manufacturers to increase the amount of armor frames could carry without
much need for compensation in propulsion. Since martian frames need to
opperate off-mars, the need for strong legt arose. Martian machinery tends
to be on the bigger side.
<br><br>
For armament, manufacturers prefered physical and explosive weaponry. Opting
for high calliber cannons and mortars instead of energy expensive weaponry.
<br><br>
Mechanized frames of the Martian Red Army often bear a red color to blend
into their native enviornment and yellow insignia.
<br><br>
Symbols of the army can range from simple depictions of Mars in its current
state, with one small moon. Mars with two moons is the symbol of units that
have a longer lasting tradition, reaching back to the Siege of Mars and some
more esoteric units field old symbold from cradle-cultures that got
rediscovered in Massif vaults.
